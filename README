		     Haskell Completion on Emacs

This package enables many completions for Haskell programming in Haskell.
Flymake is also integrated.

The "ghc-mod" program written in Haskell is a backend to gather
information from GHC.

Elisp libraries including ghc-mod is an extension to haskell-mode.
You should put the followings in your "~/.emacs.el":

    (autoload 'ghc-init "ghc" nil t)
    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (ghc-init)))

or

    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (ghc-init) (flymake-mode)))
