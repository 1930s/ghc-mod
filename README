		     Haskell Completion on Emacs

This package enables many completions for Haskell programming in Haskell.

The "ghc-mod" program written in Haskell is a backend to gather
completion information of Haskell modules with GHC.

Elisp libraries including ghc-mod is an extension to haskell-mode.
You should put the followings in your "~/.emacs.el":

(autoload 'ghc-init "ghc" nil t)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (ghc-init)))
