\report{Kazu Yamamoto}%11/14
\status{open source, actively developed}
\makeheader

For a long time, Kazu Yamamoto is the only active developer of ghc-mod.
Now two new developers joined:

Alejandro Serrano merged his results of Google Summer of Code. He
implements case splitting and sophisticated type hole handling.
Daniel Gr√∂ber brushed up the internal code by bringing the GhcMod
monad. So, the API of \texttt{ghc-mod} drastically changed.
The result was released \texttt{ghc-mod} version 5.0

\texttt{ghc-modi} used to suffer from inconsistency if an environment
changes.  For instance, file names of modules change, new dependencies
are added to its cabal file, new libraries are installed, and so on.
\texttt{ghc-modi} v5.1.1 or later captures this kind of changes and
restarts a new session.

Kazu stepped down from the release manager and Daniel took it over.
