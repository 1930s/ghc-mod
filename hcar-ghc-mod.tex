\report{Kazu Yamamoto}%11/14
\status{open source, actively developed}
\makeheader

For a long time, Kazu Yamamoto was the only active developer of ghc-mod, now two
new developers have joined:

Alejandro Serrano merged the results of his Google Summer of Code project. He
implemented case splitting and sophisticated typed hole handling.  Daniel Gr√∂ber
brushed up the internal code and introduced the GhcModT monad now used
throughout the exported API. As a result the API of \texttt{ghc-mod} drastically
changed with version 5.0.0.

\texttt{ghc-modi} used to suffer from various consistency related issues
triggered by changes in the environment, for instance: changing file names of
modules, adding dependencies to the cabal file and installing new libraries.
\texttt{ghc-modi} v5.1.1 or later handles changes in the environment by
restarting the GHC session when this is detected.

Kazu stepped down as release manager and Daniel took over.
